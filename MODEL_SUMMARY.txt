The AI Interview Analyzer uses a combination of lightweight NLP models and an offline speech-to-text engine to evaluate interview responses. Whisper-Small is used for accurate CPU-based transcription of audio inputs, producing clean text even from noisy recordings. The text is then processed through multiple analysis components: VADER sentiment analysis for detecting tone (positive/neutral/negative), TextBlob for clarity and grammar scoring, and NLTK for keyword extraction and filler-word detection. A rule-based confidence estimator evaluates how confidently the candidate speaks, while a summarization module generates a short, meaningful overview of the response. Together, these models produce a structured feedback report containing sentiment trends, clarity scores, keywords, summary, and personalized improvement suggestions.
